              <p>In 2007, Razia Jan founded Razia’s Ray of Hope Foundation on the belief that education 
              is the key to positive, peaceful change for current and future generations. Razia brought 
              girls’ education to a rural Afghan community for the very first time, and the resulting 
              transformation has been nothing short of remarkable. The foundation improves the lives of 
              Afghan girls through community-based education, in addition to the provision of necessities 
              like food and warm winter clothing, understanding that we must empower girls and young women 
              through both education and resources to work toward brighter futures in their own villages and 
              beyond.</p>
