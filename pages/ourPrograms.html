                    <p>The Zabuli Education Center (ZEC) is a private, K-6 school for girls located in the rural village
                        of Deh'Subz, about an hour outside of Kabul. Since 2008, the school has provided free, exemplary
                        education to over 1,000 students along with uniforms, shoes, warm coats, healthy meals, school
                        supplies, clean bathrooms, and safe transportation.​</p>
                    <p>ZEC students range in age from 4 to 12. Prior to enrollment, students take placement tests to
                        assess academic level, as students of the same age can vary widely in grade level.​</p>
                    <p>In 2019, the Zabuli Education Center was one of four schools to receive the Ministry’s excellence
                        award from among 140 public and private schools in Kabul Province.</p>
